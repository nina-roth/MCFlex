# MCFlex
A Monte-Carlo Integrator with user-defined functions

Disclaimer: still under development, but should be functional

Main.cpp has a few examples of user defined functions and how to call the MC Integrator.

To build:
- download mcflex-(VERSION).tar.gz and unpack using tar -xf mcflex-0.1.tar.gz
- enter directory mcflex-(VERSION)
- ./configure
- make
- make check (optional: runs minimal tests)
- make install
